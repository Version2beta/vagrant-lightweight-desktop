# vagrant-lightweight-desktop

A lightweight Openbox desktop installation for Ubuntu 12.04

## Requires

[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org)
[Vagrant v1.0.x](http://vagrantup.com)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
1. Change directories to this repository.
1. Run ```vagrant up```.

It will launch a VirtualBox window with the Vagrant box inside it. Log in with password 'password' and run ```startx``` to start X windows. Note that the window manager is the austere Openbox. Right click for a menu of installed programs.

## Nota benna

This repository currently works with Vagrant 1.0x, but probably not with Vagrant >= 1.1.x. I'll probably update it eventually, and you'll know I did because this note will be missing.

vagrant-lightweight-desktop
===========================

A lightweight Openbox desktop installation for Ubuntu 12.04

Run this against "precise64" or similar Ubuntu box from Vagrant. It will launch a VirtualBox window with the Vagrant box inside it. Log in with password 'password' and run ```startx``` to start X windows. Note that the window manager is the austere Openbox. Right click for a menu of installed programs.

This currently works with Vagrant 1.0x, but probably not with Vagrant >= 1.1.x.
